# 🏔️ Landslide and Flood Prediction and Alert System
## 🧩 Problem Statement

Landslides and floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, causing immense loss of life, property, and infrastructure — particularly in regions like India with heavy monsoon rainfall and unstable terrain.
Traditional disaster prediction systems rely on static thresholds and outdated models that fail to capture the complex interactions between climatic and environmental factors. Moreover, alert dissemination in remote areas is often delayed or inaccessible due to limited internet connectivity and lack of real-time communication systems.
This results in inaccurate forecasts, late warnings, and poor preparedness, leaving vulnerable communities exposed to severe damage and loss.

## 💡 Solution

This project proposes a Machine Learning–based prediction and alert system that can forecast the likelihood of landslides and floods using both historical and live weather data.
The system integrates real-time climate information from weather APIs and uses models such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to generate risk predictions.

A web-based dashboard displays real-time alerts, risk zones, and safety information, while an automated alert dissemination system broadcasts warnings via SMS and web notifications, ensuring that even those without constant internet access receive timely alerts.

By combining machine learning, real-time data streaming, and automated communication, this system enhances disaster preparedness, reduces false alarms, and helps communities and authorities take proactive measures to minimize damage and save lives.
